[A]. RIDGE Regression
    
   ✒️ It gives same importance to all fetures
   ✒️ Reduces the size of coefficient to reduce the chances of 'overfitting'

   Parameters....

   [a]. alpha : [1.0] (regularization strength)
        ✒️ It controls how much regularization you apply
        ✒️ Low alpha : Almost no regularization (behave like standard LinearRegression)
	✒️ High alpha : Lots of regularization, model shrinks the coefficients aggressively
   
   [b]. fit_intercept : [True]
        ✒️ Determines whether to include an intercept or not

   [c]. solver 
	✒️ Which algorithm is used to find the optimal solution of Ridge Regression
 
 	solvers.
		➡️ 'auto' :
			✒️ automatically selects the best solver
		➡️ 'svd' :
			✒️ Works well, when number of fetures is smaller than number of samples
		➡️ 'cholesky' :
			✒️ Fast and works well on smaller datasets
		➡️ 'lsqr' :
			✒️ An iterative solver, userful if your data is larger
		➡️ 'sag' & 'saga' :
			✒️ Efficient for large dataset, assumes that the features are already scaled

    [d]. max_iter [Depends on solver]
	 ✒️ Maximum number of iteration the solver will take
	 ✒️ If your model is taking too long to converge(of find the best solution), you can increase this number

    [e]. tol : [1e-3] (tolerance)
	 ✒️ Sets the tolerance for stopping criteria.
	 ✒️ It means that when the model has found a solution that doesn't improve much, it will stop early,
             saving time.
	 ✒️ In simple words, if model is improving by only tiny amounts, it stops looking for better solution.
    
    [f]. random_state : [None]
    
    [g]. copy_x : [True]
 
    [h]. positive : [False]

[B]. LASSO Regression

    ✒️ It forces you to prioritize by shrinking some coefficients down to zero.
    ✒️ It can remove unnecessary variables entirely, helping feature selection & simplifying the model

    [a]. alpha : [1.0]

    [b]. fit_intercept : [True]

    [c]. precompute : [auto]
         ✒️ Whether to precompute the gram matrix to speed up computations.
         ✒️ Useful in large datasets where repeated calculations can slow down the process.
         ✒️ It's like a faster route for model to find the solution.
	 ✒️ If dataset is large, it saves time by precomputing some stuff in advance.

    [d]. max_iter : [1000]
         ✒️ Maximum number of iterations allowed to find the optimal solution.
         ✒️ This is the effort limit, If model takes too long to find the best solution, you can increase that number

    [e]. tol : [1e-4]

    [f]. selection : [cyclic]
	 ✒️ How to choose the features to update at each iteration.
 	 ✒️ How the model decides to tweak things
              ➡️ 'cyclic'
			✒️ Update features one by one.
              ➡️ 'random'
			✒️ Update features in random order, which can sometimes converge faster.

    [i]. positive : [False]
